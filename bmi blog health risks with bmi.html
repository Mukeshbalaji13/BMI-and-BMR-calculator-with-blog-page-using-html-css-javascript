    <h1>HEALTH RISKS WITH BMI</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You may have an increased chance of getting the following illnesses if your BMI is under 18.5 (underweight):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Malnutrition</li>
      <li>Anemia</li>
      <li>Immune system weakness, which can make infections and diseases more common</li>
      <li>Osteoporosis</li>
      <li>Infertility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your doctor may recommend certain tests such as blood and other diagnostic procedures if you are underweight in order to assess your general health and determine whether you are malnourished.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, the underlying issues are more prone to affect individuals if your BMI is greater:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heart conditions</li>
      <li>Hypertension or high blood pressure</li>
      <li>Diabetes type 2</li>
      <li>Gallstones</li>
      <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
      <li>A few malignancies, such as those of the colon, breast, endometrium, and gallbladder</li>
      <li>Depressive disorders along with other mental health issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep in mind that you might have one of the aforementioned health issues despite having an elevated body mass index (BMI). The same is true for having an elevated BMI without any of these disorders. The occurrence of these disorders is greatly influenced by both genetics and other elements, such as cigarette smoking.</p>
    <p>Your doctor will likely request specific blood tests, which could include a comprehensive metabolic panel and lipids panel, to evaluate your general health if your BMI indicates that you may be obese.</p>


    <h3>Risks associated with being overweight and Obese</h3>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi overweight and obese.webp" alt="overweight and obese">
    <p>The causes of various significant diseases and  also health issues increases with weight gain. According to the Centreâ€™s for Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC), the following risks are listed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>High blood pressure</li>
      <li>High triglyceride levels</li>
      <li>low HDL levels(which are generally regarded as "good cholesterol in moderation," and an elevated level of LDL cholesterol, which is typically seen as "bad cholesterol") all contribute to high blood pressure</li> 
      <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
      <li>Type II diabetes.</li>
      <li>Strokes</li>
      <li>Gallbladder conditions</li>
      <li>Low quality of life</li>
      <li>some malignancies (endometrial, colon, breast, kidney, gallbladder, liver)</li>
      <li>sleep apnea</li>
      <li>breathing issues</li>
      <li>osteoarthritis(a kind of joint disease brought on by the degradation of joint cartilage)</li>
      <li>certain sleep disorders</li>
      <li>Generalized higher mortality risk in comparison to people with a normal BMI.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The list above demonstrates the vast range of detrimental, and sometimes fatal, consequences of being fat might have issues that Ideally a person should see their doctor to decide if they require to make any adjustments to their living if they want to be healthier. In general, a person must try and keep a BMI below 25 kg/m2.</p>
    <p>Based on the correlation with obesity and disease and mortality, the BMI ranges were developed. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of contracting the following illnesses:</p>
    <p>Obesity is linked to a number of illnesses and ailments, including osteoarthritis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, especially type 2, obstructive sleeping apnoea, some types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Obesity has been demonstrated to shorten life expectancy as a result.</p>


    <h4>Mortality</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi mortality.webp" alt="mortality" class="small-img">
    <p>One of the biggest avoidable causes of death in the world is obesity. According to several reviews, the risk of dying is lowest for non-smokers at a BMI of 20 to 25 kg/m2 and for current smokers at a BMI of 24 to 27 kg/m2, with risk rising with modifications in either direction.</p>


    <h4>Morbidity</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks of bmi morbidity.jpg" alt="morbidity" class="medium-img">
    <p>The risk of numerous physical and mental disorders rises with obesity. The metabolic syndrome, a concoction of medical conditions that includes diabetes, especially type 2, elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol in the blood, and high triglyceride levels, is where these concurrent medical conditions are most frequently observed.</p>
    <p>Obesity either directly causes complications or indirectly contributes to them via factors like a bad diet or being inactive. The degree to which obesity and particular illnesses are related varies. The relationship with diabetes of the type 2 variety is one of the strongest. 64% of instances of diabetes in males and 77% of incidences in women are caused by excess body fat.</p>
    <p>The effects of increased fat mass, such as developing osteoarthritis obstructive sleep apnoea and social stigmatisation, and the effects of increased fat cells, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, can both have negative health effects. Insulin resistance may result from changes in the body's reaction to insulin brought on by increases in body fat. Additionally, increased fat causes a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic condition.</p>
    <p>A significant risk factor for a variety of long-lasting physical and mental diseases is obesity. The widely held belief is that overweight people have identical health issues to obese people.</p>
  
  
    <h4>Cardio logical issues</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi cardiological issues.jpg" alt="cardiological issues" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Ischemic heart disease</h5>
    <p>Cardiovascular illnesses which include symptoms of angina and myocardial infarction, or MI, are linked to obesity. A 2002 study found that obesity causes 21% of cardiovascular heart disease, and a 2008 European agreement put the figure at 35%.</p>
    <h5>Congestive heart failure</h5>
    <p>Obesity is linked to 11% of cases of congestive heart failure in men and 14% of cases in women.</p>
    <h5>High blood pressure</h5>
    <p>Over eighty percent of people who have BP have a BMI of 25 or higher. In comparison to people who are of a healthy weight, the possibility of hypertension is five times higher in obese people. Animal and clinical research has clearly shown a connection between fat and hypertension, and they also point to a number of plausible processes that could be at play. Both the nervous system's sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are activated as part of these mechanisms. Additionally well documented is the link between childhood obesity and hypertension.</p>
    <h5>Abnormal cholesterol levels</h5>
    <p>Increased levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol) are linked to obesity.</p>
    <h5>Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism</h5>
    <p>A person's chance of a venous thromboembolism is 2.3 times higher if they are obese.</p>


    <h4>Dermatological</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi dermatological.webp" alt="Dermatological" class="medium-img">
    <p>The appearance of stretch marks, a condition known as nigricans, lymph node swelling, cellulitis, hirsuteness and intertrigo are all more common in obese people.</p>
    

    <h4>Endocrine</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi endocrine.jpg" alt="endocrine" class="medium-img">
    <ul>
      <li>A male with obesity who develops gynecomastia.</li>
      <li>Diabetes mellitus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Gynecomastia</h5>
    <p>A 2009 review found that obesity may be linked to higher peripheral androgen to oestrogen conversion in some people.</p>


    <h4>Gastrointestinal</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi gastrointestinal.png" alt="gastrointestinal" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</h5>
    <p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that obese people experience GERD symptoms more frequently and more severely.</p>
    <h5>Cholelithiasis (gallstones)</h5>
    <p>In accordance with the NIH, obesity raises the level of cholesterol in bile, which can lead to the development of stones.</p>


    <h4>Reproductive system (or genital system)</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and blog health risks with bmi reproductive system.avif" alt="reproductive system" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)</h5>
    <p>Adiposity raises the possibility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is linked to insulin resistance. Nearly 60% of PCOS patients in the US have a BMI of greater than 30. It is still unclear whether PCOS causes obesity or vice versa.</p>
    <h5>Infertility</h5>
    <p>Both male and female infertility is caused by obesity. This is mainly because too much oestrogen affects men's spermatogenesis and women's natural ovulation. It is thought to be the root of six percent of primary infertility. According to a 2013 research, males who are obese had a 1.3 odds ratio higher chance of developing oligospermia and azoospermia. Obesity with morbidity raises the chances ratio to 2.0.</p>
    <h5>Complications of pregnancy</h5>
    <p>Obesity is linked to a number of pregnancy issues, such as haemorrhage, infection, more time in the hospital for the mother, and increasing NICU needs for the baby. Comparing to women of average weight, obese women undergo C-sections at a rate that is more than twice as high.Obese mothers are also more likely to give birth prematurely and to babies who are underweight at delivery.</p>
    <h5>Birth defects</h5>
    <p>Pregnant women who are obese run a higher risk of giving birth to children who have a variety of congenital malformations, such as hydrocephaly, cleft lips and palates, anorectal defect, a limb reduction abnormalities, and neural tube defects like anencephaly and spina bifida.</p>


    <h4>Neurological</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi neurological.jpg" alt="Neurological" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Ischemic stroke</h5>
    <p>both the male and female obese categories are affected.</p>
    <h5>Meralgia paresthetica</h5>
    <p>Meralgia paresthetica remains a type of neuropathic thigh pain or numbness that is occasionally linked to obesity.</p>
    <h5>Migraines</h5>
    <p>Obesity and migraines often coexist. By a BMI of 30 kilogrammes per square meter and a BMI of 35 kg/m2, the possibility of migraine increases by 50% and 100%, respectively.It's unclear what caused the relationship.</p>
    <h5>Carpal tunnel syndrome</h5>
    <p>Each kg/m2 increase in body mass index causes a 7.4% increase in the probability of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
    <h5>Dementia</h5>
    <p>people who are obese have 1.5 times greater rate of dementia when compared to normal ones.</p>
    <h5>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension</h5>
    <p>Undiagnosed high pressure in the brain, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is an uncommon illness that can impair vision and result in frequent, excruciating headaches and tinnitus. Obese females are most frequently affected by it.</p>
    <h5>Multiple sclerosis</h5>
    <p>Women who are overweight at age 18 has a greater rate of increased risk of MS.</p>


    <h4>Cancer (oncological)</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi cancer.jpg" alt="cancer" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Hepatocellular carcinoma 1</h5>
    <p>Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing many malignancies. According to a UK study, being overweight contributes to about 5% of cancer cases.Breast, ovarian, esophageal, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, endometrial, cervical, and prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are among these malignancies.In the UK, several prevalent malignancies, involving 41 percent of cancers of the uterus and a minimum of ten percent of gallbladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers, are linked to an increased risk of development in people with high body mass indexes (BMI). Obesity is linked to a higher risk of serious postoperative complications in cancer patients after surgery as compared to people who are of normal weight.</p>


    <h4>Psychiatric</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi psychiatric.jpg" alt="psychiatric" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Depression</h5>
    <p>Depression and obesity have been linked in studies.The link is stronger in younger people, women, and people who are more seriously fat.The suicide rate does, however, decline as BMI rises.</p>
    <h5>Social stigmatization</h5>
    <p>According to a systematic analysis published in 2011, obese people tend to elicit negative sentiments and have lower levels of willingness to accept assistance from others.</p>


    <h4>Respiratory system</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi respiratory system.jpg" alt="respiratory system" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Obesity hypoventilation syndrome</h5>
    <p>Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterised by the occurrence of being overweight, hypoxia during sleeping, and hypercapnia during the daytime as a result of hypoventilation.</p>
    <h5>Chronic lung disease</h5>
    <p>Asthma and COPD are just two of the chronic respiratory conditions that obesity is linked to. It's thought that several obesity-related factors may generate an underlying pro-inflammatory state that contributes to asthmatic airway inflammation.</p>
    <h5>Complications during general anaesthesia</h5>
    <p>The physiological lung volume is greatly decreased and stiffened with obesity, necessitating specialised respiratory management techniques while under general anaesthesia.</p>
    <h5>Obesity and Asthma</h5>
    <p>It has been demonstrated that obesity-related low-grade systemic inflammation worsens asthmatic patients' lung function and raises their risk of asthma exacerbations.</p>


    <h4>Rheumatological and orthopedic</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi rheumatological and orthopaedic.jpg" alt="Rheumatological and orthopedic" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Gout</h5>
    <p>Men having a BMI of 30-35 have 2.3 times as much gout as men having a BMI of 21-23, while those with a BMI of 35 or above had 3.0 times as much gout. These dangers are reduced by weight loss.</p>
    <h5>Poor mobility</h5>
    <p>There is an aggressive interconnection between the obesity and musculoskeletal pain and disabling issues.</p>
    <h5>Osteoarthritis</h5>
    <p>Most weight-bearing as well as non-weight-bearing joints exhibit rates of arthritis. Osteoarthritis risk is lowered by exercise and weight loss.</p>
    <h5>Low back pain</h5>
    <p>Obese peoples are 2 to 4 times more prone to get lower back ache than the normal weight ones.</p>
    <h5>Traumatic injury</h5>
    <p>among women, class II obesity that is BMI under 35 is a complicated factor for osteoporotic fractures in general, as well as for upper arm fractures.</p>


    <h4>Urological and nephrological</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog health risks with bmi urological and nephrological.jpg" alt="Urological and nephrological" class="medium-img">
    <h5>Urinary incontinence</h5>
    <p>The rates of urge, anxiety, and mixed incontinence are all higher in obese people. The rates are roughly twice as high as those observed in people of normal weight. With weight loss, urinary incontinence gets better.</p>
    <h5>Hypogonadism</h5>
    <p>Being overweight and a metabolic disorder both boost the synthesis of oestrogen and adipokines in males. Due to a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone, the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are also decreased. As a result, the production of testosterone by the testicles decreases, and levels of adipokines rise further. This then feeds back, leading to additional weight gain.</p>
    <h5>Erectile dysfunction</h5>
    <p>Although erectile dysfunction can occur in obese men (as well as in connection with diabetes), their sexual performance improves when they lose weight.</p>


    <h3>Risks associated with being underweight</h3>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks underweight image.jpg" alt="underweight">
    <p>There are hazards linked with being underweight, which are described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and increases the risk of breaking a bone; malnutrition; vitamin deficiency; anaemia (decreased capability to carry blood vessels)</li>
      <li>Impaired immunological response</li>
      <li>Problems with growth and development, especially in young people </li>
      <li>Potential reproductive problems for women associated with hormonal imbalances that may interfere with the menstrual cycle. In addition, overweight women are more likely to miscarry in the first trimester, face a higher risk of surgical complications, and have a higher mortality risk overall than those with a normal body mass index (BMI).</li>
      <li>Being underweight is occasionally a symptom of an illness or underlying condition, including anorexia nervosa, which carries hazards of its own. If you believe that you or anyone you recognize is underweight, go to your doctor right once, especially if the cause does not seem clear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Weight loss brought on by certain medical diseases might result in underweight individuals. These consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gastrointestinal issues such nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea</li>
      <li>an infection</li>
      <li>lung illness, HIV, or cancer</li>
      <li>Diabetes and thyroid issues</li>
      <li>Crohn's illness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Someone who is underweight may also have mental health issues. These consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dementia</li>
      <li>eating disorders(anorexia nervosa and bulimia)</li>
      <li>anxiety</li>
      <li>stress</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Malnutrition</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks malnutrition.jpeg" alt="malnutrition" class="medium-img">
    <p>You might not be consuming enough nutritious foods containing essential nutrients to sustain your body if you are underweight. That might result in malnutrition. Malnutrition can have a range of long-term effects on your health, some of which may be apparent to you or people around you.</p>
    <p>Your signs could consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>undergoing fatigue or a less amount of energy</li>
      <li>having irregular or missing periods in females</li>
      <li>feeling sick frequently or having trouble fending off disease</li>
      <li>enduring loss of hair</li>
      <li>dry skin</li>
      <li>dental problems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are underweight and your low BMI is brought on by a diet that is not balanced or a condition that impairs nutrition absorption, you might be at greater risk to also be malnourished. Anaemia or a lack of vital vitamins can result from malnutrition. Deficiencies in nutritional absorption might also result in anaemia.</p>

    <h4>Decreased immune</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks decreased immune.jpg" alt="decreased immune" class="medium-img">
    <p>Elevated infections along with being underweight are related, according to studies. The researchers acknowledged their difficulty in figuring out whether this is the consequence of becoming underweight or if the underlying causes of being underweight are more to blame. For instance, malnutrition might result in weakened immunity and underweight individuals. To fully comprehend the relationship between weight and immunological function, more research is required.</p>

    <h4>Osteoporosis</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks osteoporosis.jpg" alt="osteoporosis" class="medium-img">
    <p>Low density of bones (BMD) and osteoporosis risk factors may be exacerbated by low body weight. Twenty-four percent of women having a BMI of 18.5 or less had low BMD, according to one study that examined bone mineral density in 1,767 premenopausal women. With a BMI more than 18.5, only 9.4% of subjects had poor BMD. According to the study's findings, osteoporosis risk rises with underweight status.</p>

    <h4>Infertility</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks infertility.jpg" alt="infertility" class="medium-img">
    <p>Low BMI women are more likely to experience amenorrhea, which is the lack of menstruation, along with other menstrual cycle disorders. Anovulation, or the lack of ovulation, may be indicated by irregular or skipped menstrual cycles. Infertility may result from persistent anovulation. Consult your doctor if you're attempting to get pregnant and are underweight. They can perform a quick blood test to determine whether you ovulate consistently. They can check for further indicators of infertility. Prior to becoming pregnant, your doctor could advise achieving a healthy weight. For your unborn child, becoming underweight during pregnant can be risky. Because of this, it's crucial to keep a healthy weight when pregnant.</p>

    <h4>Developmental delays</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks developmental delays.jpg" alt="developmental delays" class="medium-img">
    <p>Children who are underweight, particularly those below the age of three while the brain is quickly developing, can have developmental problems. For optimal development, the brain need nutrition. Children who are underweight may lack essential nutrients as a result of malnutrition and malabsorption. This may affect brain growth and cause developmental milestones to be delayed. At well-visit appointments, your child's paediatrician will keep track of your child's development. These measurements will be used to compare your child's growth to that of other kids his or her age on average and to track changes in your child's percentages over time. Your child may not be acquiring weight at the anticipated rate if their growth percentage starts to decline. For instance, if your child's percentiles at their 12-month and 15-month visits are 45 and 35, respectively, then their doctor might be worried about weight gain. During routine checkups, your child's paediatrician will inquire about developmental milestones as well. Just keep in mind that not all kids reach milestones at the exact same time. Instead, medical professionals check to determine if your kid hits them within a specific window of time. For instance, some kids start walking before they turn a year old, while others don't till they are a few months through their first academic year. If your kid is also behind on other developmental milestones, training to talk or walk later won't indicate a concern.</p>

    <h4>Irregular periods</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks irregular periods.jpg" alt="irregular periods" class="small-img">
    <p>Women suffering from underweight might have irregular menstruation, menstruation stopping, or a delayed or missed first period in adolescents. Infertility might result from irregular or dysmenorrhea menstruation.</p>

    <h4> Skin, hair, or teeth problems</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks skin hair teeth.jpg" alt="skin hair teeth" class="small-img">
    <p>A person may exhibit physical symptoms, that include premature ageing, balding, dry skin, and poor dental health, if they do not consume sufficient nutrients in their everyday meals.</p>

    <h4>Getting sick frequently</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks getting sick frequently.jpg" alt="getting sick" class="small-img">
    <p>A person might not be receiving sufficient nutrients for fighting off infections if they are not getting sufficient energy from their food for maintaining a healthy body weight. As an conclusion, sickness including the cold might stay longer than they usually would and a individual might be prone to become unwell most repeatedly.</p>

    <h4>Feeling tired all the time</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks feeling tired.jpg" alt="feeling tired" class="small-img">
    <p>Calories are a unit of measurement for the amount of energy that a specific food can provide. A person may feel worn out if they aren't eating sufficient calories for maintaining a healthy weight.</p>

    <h4>Anemia</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi blog screening for health risks anemia.jpg" alt="anemia" class="small-img">
    <p>Anaemia is a disease noted by lower amount of  blood levels  that could lead a individual in tiredness, headaches, and also nausea, is most common among underweight individuals.</p>
