    <h1>LIMITATIONS OF BMI</h1>
  </div>
<div class="content">
  
  <p>Even while BMI is a widely used and valuable indicator of an ideal body weight, it has several limitations. Body composition cannot be taken into account by BMI, which is only an approximate indicator. Because there are many different body types and variations in muscle, bone, and fat distribution, BMI should be used in conjunction with various other parameters rather than as the only way to establish a the individual's healthy body weight.</p>

  
  <h3>In adults</h3>
  <img src="bmi and bmr blog limitations of bmi in adults.jpg" alt="limitations of bmi in adults">
    <p>Because BMI measures extra body weight instead of excess body fat, it cannot be completely correct. Additional variables that affect BMI include gender, age, ethnic background, strength, body fat, and amount of activity. For instance, an elderly person with a healthy weight who is fully sedentary in every day may have a lot of extra fat despite not being overweight. In contrast, a younger individual with a higher muscle composition and the same BMI would be seen as healthy. It is entirely feasible that sportsmen, especially bodybuilder who would be labelled overweight because muscle weighs more than fat, may actually be at an acceptable weight for their overall physique. 
    <br/><br/>According to the CDC, in general:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Women prefer to contain a greater percentage of body fat than men for a comparable BMI.</li>
        <li>People who are muscular or who are professional athletes might have higher BMIs because of substantial muscle mass.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>In children and adolescents</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog limitations of bmi in children and adolescents.webp" alt="limitations of bmi in children and adolescents">
    <p>The same factors that limit BMI efficacy in adults can also have an impact on children and adolescents. Height and the level of sexual development could also impact the children's BMI and also the total body fat. Compared to overweight young ones, whose BMI may be caused by greater amounts of neither fat or mass that is fat-free (all body parts other than fat, including water, organs, muscle, etc.), obese children have a BMI that is a stronger sign of extra body fat. Slender children's body fat-free mass may also be to blame for the variance in BMI. Nevertheless, for 90% to 95% of the total population, the BMI is an appreciable requirement for the total body fat rate and could be used in the interconnected format with any other metrics in order to assist and identify a individuals healthy body mass.</p>

    
    <h3>Limitations of using BMI to help diagnose weight types</h3>
    <img src="bmi and bmr blog limitations of bmi problems associated with weight types.jpg" alt="limitations of bmi problems associated with weight types">
    <p>When it comes to identifying different weight categories, the commonly used BMI has some drawbacks, such as the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It doesn't distinguish among lean body mass and fat mass. As a result, someone can be incredibly strong and have an elevated body weight while still having an extremely small fat mass, and vice versa.</li>
        <li>The BMI chart hasn't been updated to account for the rising typical adult height over time, despite the fact that adults who were given the gender male at birth (AMAB) as well as adults who were allocated female at birth (AFAB) often have a greater percentage of body fat than adults AMAB.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The following populations shouldn't be evaluated for body fat using the usual BMI chart</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bodybuilders and sportspeople.</li>
        <li>Young people in their teens.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women.</li>
        <li>Seniors 65 and older.</li>
        <li>Those who experience muscle atrophy (wasting) as a result of illnesses.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Limitations of BMI as a health problem screening tool</h3>
    <p>There are numerous drawbacks to using a body mass index (BMI) as a screening tool to determine the risk of developing specific diseases, which include Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including:</p>
    <img src="bmi blog limitaions of bmi as a health problem screening tool.webp" alt="bmi as a health problem screening tool" class="medium-img">
    <ul>
      <li>Body fat location or distribution are not measured by the BMI. This is problematic considering excess fat accumulation in some parts of the body, such as the abdomen, is linked to an increased likelihood of medical conditions compared to excess fat accumulation in other parts of the body, such as the thighs.</li>
      <li>The association between BMI and rate of death frequently fails to take into account factors like familial longevity (average life expectancy); high blood pressure, heart disease, and elevated cholesterol (dyslipidemia); and family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypertension.</li>
      <li>Not all healthcare professionals define different weight kinds using BMI.</li>
      <li>Measuring the circumference of the waist is another tool.</li>
      <li>Using skin fold caliper to measure the thickness of the skin in specific places on the body, such as the backs of your upper arms and between your shoulder blades.</li>
      <li>Less often used tests include the DEXA test scan and air displacement plethysmography (ADP).</li>
    </ul>
