    <h1>FACTORS INFLUENCING BMR</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The basal metabolic rate(BMR) is influenced by various number of factors. They involve body temperature, age, gender, race, emotional state, climate, and circulatory levels of hormones such as catecholamines (epinephrine as well as norepinephrine) and thyroid hormones.</p>
    <h4>Genetics (Race)</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-bmr variables-genetics.webp" alt="genetics" class="small-img">
    <p> certain individuals are born with a faster metabolism than others. Indians and Chinese people appear to have lower BMRs than Europeans. This could be because to dietary disparities between different races. Individuals that live in tropical climes have a higher BMR. As an example, consider Singapore.</p>
    <h4>Gender</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-gender.png" alt="gender" class="small-img">
    <p>Men have more muscle mass & a lesser body fat percentage. Men, as a result, possess a greater basal metabolic rate compared to women. Females' BMR drops more faster than males' around their ages of five and seventeen.</p>
    <h4>Age</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-age.webp" alt="age" class="small-img">
    <p>BMR decreases with age, or is inversely related to age. Children's BMR is higher than adults'. At 20 years, it diminishes by around 2% every decade.</p>
    <h4>Body Mass Index(BMI)</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-body mass index.avif" alt="body mass index" class="small-img">
    <p>The greater the BMI, the higher the BMR; for example, the rate of metabolism of obese women approximately twenty-five percent greater than that of lean women.</p>
    <h4>Body surface area</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-body surface area.jpg" alt="body surface area" class="small-img">
    <p>This is determined by height and weight. The higher the BMR, the higher the body circumference factor. BMRs are greater in tall, skinny people. When an individual who is tall is compared to a short person of comparable weight, the shortest individual might put on as much as 15 pounds in a year if both individuals follow a calorie-controlled diet in order to preserve the body mass index of the taller person.</p>
    <h4>Percentage of body fat</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-percentage of body fat.jpg" alt="percentage of body fat" class="small-img">
    <p>The greater the BMR, the lesser the body fat percentage. One reason men have a 10-15 percent greater BMR than women is because they have a lower body fat percentage.</p>
    <h4>Diet</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-diet.webp" alt="diet" class="small-img">
    <p>Starvation or severe rapid calorie restriction can drop BMR from up to 30%. Limited low-calorie losing weight diets can reduce BMR by up to 20%. BMR is 11% lower in committed vegetarians than in meat eaters.</p>
    <h4>Body temperature/health</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-body temperature.webp" alt="body temperature" class="small-img">
    <p>For every 0.5° C increase in internal body temperature, the BMR rises by around 7%. At greater temperatures, chemical processes in the body occur more quickly. So, an individual having a body temperature of 42° C (approximately 4° C higher normal) might have a 50% rise in BMR. The rise in the body's temperature as an outcome of fever raises the basal metabolic rate (BMR) by 14-15% each degree centigrade, which is clearly linked to the higher rate of metabolism.</p>
    <h4>Temperature outside</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-temperature outside.webp" alt="temperature outside" class="small-img">
    <p>The environmental temperature exterior the body has an effect on the basal metabolic rate as well. When exposed to cold temperatures, the BMR increases in order to generate the extra heat required to maintain the body's internal temperature. A brief exposure to high temperatures has no impact on the body's metabolism because it is primarily compensated for by greater heat loss. However, prolonged exposure to heat might hightened the BMR.</p>
    <h4>Glands</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-glands.jpg" alt="Glands" class="small-img">
    <p>Thyroxine is a crucial BMR-regulator that increases the body's metabolic activity. The greater the BMR, the more thyroxine produced. BMR can actually double if excessive thyroxine is produced (thyrotoxicosis). BMR can drop to 30-40% of normal if inadequate thyroxine is generated (myxoedema). Adrenaline, like thyroxine, stimulates BMR, albeit to a smaller level. Anxiety and tension might not appear on the face, but they cause muscle tensing and a discharge of norepinephrine even when the patient appears to be peaceful. Both of these things tend to raise metabolic rate.</p>
    <h4>Exercise</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-exercise.jpg" alt="exercise" class="small-img">
    <p>Exercise not only affects one's weight by reducing body fat, but it also helps raise BMR by developing extra lean tissue. (Lean tissue has a higher metabolic requirement than fat tissue.) As a result, even while sleeping, more calories are burned.</p>
    <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-factors influencing bmr-pregnancy.webp" alt="pregnancy" class="small-img">
    <p>The BMR remains constant during pregnancy. The greater BMR value in late stages of pregnancy is attributable to the foetal BMR.</p>
