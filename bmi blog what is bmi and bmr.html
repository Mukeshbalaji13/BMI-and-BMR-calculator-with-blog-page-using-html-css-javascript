    <h1>WHAT IS BMI AND BMR?</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h3>What is body mass index (BMI)?</h3>
    <img src="bmi and bmr assets/what is bmi and bmr bmi intro.jpg" alt="body mass index">
    <p>A medical screening tool called the body mass index (BMI) calculates the ratio of one's height to weight to determine how much body fat you have. BMI is determined by dividing a person's weight in kilogram (kg) by the square of their height in meter (m2). Although BMI often corresponds with body fat—the higher the score, the greater amount of fat in your body you may have—it isn't always reliable. BMI is not a diagnostic tool for health. BMI along with various tools and tests are used by medical professionals to evaluate a patient's health and risk factors. Heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes may be brought on by high body fat. Malnutrition might be interconnected with less body fat content.</p>
    <p>The proper quantity of body fat aids in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. It also gives your body a source of energy, aids in regulating body temperature, and shields your organs. The typical BMI chart should not be used to determine a child's or teen's weight. Find out from your child's doctor what weight is best for their height and age. Using your height and weight, the BMI calculates whether your weight is healthy. The ideal BMI range is thought to be between 18.5 and 24.9. It's important to remember that factors besides body fat affect general health. Your general health and the risk that you may develop specific medical diseases are both influenced by a number of other factors, including heredity, exercise level, use of tobacco or smoking, alcohol intake, and also mental health issues.</p>


    <h3>BMI formula</h3>
    <div style="background-color: white; width: max-content;">
    <p style="margin: 10px;"><b>Standard Units:</b></p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content; margin: 10px;"><b>BMI = 703 x weight(lbs) / height<sup>2</sup>(inches)</b></p>
    <p style="margin: 10px;"><b>Example:</b> 
    <br/>weight = 120 lbs 
    <br/>height = 68 inches
    <br/>BMI = 703 x 120/(68)<sup>2</sup> = 24.32</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color: white; width: max-content;">
    <p style="margin: 10px;"><b>Metric Units</b></p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content; margin: 10px;"><b>BMI = weight(kilograms) / height<sup>2</sup>(metres)</b></p>
    <p style="margin: 10px;"><b>Example:</b> 
    <br/>weight = 67.52 kilograms
    <br/>height =  1.71 metres
    <br/>BMI = 67.52/(1.71)<sup>2</sup> = 23.09</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Who can use the BMI calculator</h3>
    <p>The BMI calculator can be used by both adults and children at the age of two.</p>
    <p>The body mass index (BMI) calculation might not be applicable for those people who think that you might have an eating disorder or looking towards for the treatment. Seek advice from a doctor.</p>
    <p>While calculating your BMI when being pregnant, use you’re before pregnancy weight.</p>


    <h3>BMR</h3>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-what is bmi and bmr-bmr.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Whenever the digestive system is idle, its basal metabolic rate (BMR), which indicates the amount of energy required during resting in a temperate climate. It's the same as calculating how much gas an idle automobile consumes while parked. Energy will be utilized only to sustain important organs that include the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, the nervous system, intestinal tract, lungs, sexual organs, muscle tissue, and skin in this state. Upkeep consumes a maximum of 70 of the entire energy (calories) burned by most persons each day. Physical activity accounts for 20% of expenditure, with the remaining 10% utilized for digestion, commonly known as thermogenesis.</p>

    <h4>Mifflin-St Jeor Equation</h4>
    <h5>For men</h5>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content;"><b>BMR</b> = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5</p>
    <h5>For women</h5>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content;"><b>BMR</b> = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161</p>
    <p>where, <br/>
      <b>W</b> = body weight in kilograms <br/> 
      <b>H</b> = body height in centimeters <br/>
      <b>A</b> = age</p>

    <h4>Revised Harris-Benedict Equation</h4>
    <h5>For men</h5>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content;"><b>BMR</b> = 13.397W + 4.799H - 5.677A + 88.362</p>
    <h5>For women</h5>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content;"><b>BMR</b> = 9.247W + 3.098H - 4.330A + 447.593</p>
    <p>where, <br/>
      <b>W</b> = body weight in kilograms <br/> 
      <b>H</b> = body height in centimeters <br/>
      <b>A</b> = age</p>

    <h4>Katch-McArdle Formula</h4>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content;"><b>BMR</b> = 370 + 21.6(1 - F)W</p>
    <p>where, <br/>
      <b>F</b> = body fat percentage.</p>


      <h3>BMR formula</h3>
      <p>For men and women, the following formulas are used to compute BMR in [kcal / 24hrs]</p>
      <div style="background-color: white; width: max-content;">
      <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content; margin: 20px;"><b>Men's BMR</b> = 66.47 + (13.75 × weights [kg]) + (5.003 × size [cm]) (6.755 × age [years])</p>
      <p style="background-color: yellow; width: max-content; margin: 10px;"><b>Women's BMR</b> = 655.1 + (9.563 × weights [kg]) + (1.85 × size [cm]) (4.676 × age [years])</p>
      </div>


    <h3>Thermic effects in food</h3>
    <p>Because you spend energy to absorb, digest, and metabolize the meal you just ate, your basal metabolic rate (BMR) rises after you eat. The increase begins shortly after you begin eating and increases around two hours to three hours subsequently.</p>
    <p>This increase in BMR might range between 2% and 30%, based on the amount of food of the diet and the sorts of foods consumed.</p>
    <p>Numerous foods raise BMR in varying degrees</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fats increase BMR by 0-5 percent.</li>
      <li>Carbohydrates increase BMR by 5-10%.</li>
      <li>Proteins increase BMR by 20-30%.</li>
      <li>Spicy foods (such as chilli, horseradish, & mustard) may have a considerable thermic effect.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Significance of BMR</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The assessment of BMR is the primary guidance for thyroid disease diagnosis and treatment.</li>
      <li>Moderate hypothyroidism is indicated by BMR less than 10% of normal. In chronic hypothyroidism, the BMR might fall to 40 to 50 percent of normal.</li>
      <li>BMR assists in determining the total quantity of nutrients or calories needed for sustaining body weight.</li>
      <li>The BMR is low in patients suffering from hunger, malnutrition, hypothalamic problems, Addison's illness, and lipoid nephrosis.</li>
      <li>n conditions of fever, diabetic insipidus, leukemia, and polycythemia, the BMR is higher than normal.</li>
    </ol>
