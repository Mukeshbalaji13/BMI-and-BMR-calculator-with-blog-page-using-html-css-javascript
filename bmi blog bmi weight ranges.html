    <h1>BMI WEIGHT RANGES</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi weight ranges adults.jpg" alt="adults">
    <p>In the range of normal weight, a BMI calculation falls between 18.5 and 24.9. The normal weight level is 18.5 to 23 for minority ethnic groups like Blacks, Asians, and some others. For those of White ancestry, a BMI of 18.5 or less indicates underweight, 18.5 to 24.9 indicates healthy weight, 25 to 29.9 indicates overweight, and 30 or more indicates obesity. A lower BMI is associated with a higher risk of long-term illnesses such type 2 diabetes among Black, Asian, and several other minority ethnic groups. With a BMI of 23 or above, individuals from these groups are at elevated risk of being overweight; with 27.5 or higher, they are at high risk of being obese.</p>


    <h3>Children's BMI</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi weight ranges children.jpg" alt="children bmi">
    <p>The BMI calculator accounts for age, gender, and height and weight for kids and teenagers between the ages of 2 and 18. The BMI of a child is expressed as a "centile". The centile value provides a percentage comparison of their BMI to that of other kids their age and sex. A girl at the seventy-fifth centile, for a case, kg that is greater than seventy five out of each and every hundred females her age. The BMI calculator determines if a kid or young person is: underweight if they are on the second centile or lower; a healthy weight if they are between the second and 91st centiles; overweight if they are on the 91st centile or above; or severely overweight if they are on the 98th centile or above.</p>


    <h3>Waist to height ratio</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi weight ranges waist to height ratio.avif" alt="waist to height ratio">
    <p>Despite the fact that you have a good BMI, evaluating the waist to your height can reveal whether you have too much belly fat. Calculate the circumference of your waist and divide this number by your height in order to find your waist-to-height ratio. Use measurements that are expressed in the same units, such as centimeters or inches.</p>
    <p>A waist-to-height ratio of 0.50 or greater indicates you may be at higher risk for conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Your waist size is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate the highest point of your hips (merely above the belly button) and the bottom of your ribcage.</li>
        <li>Measure your waist halfway between these points using a tape measure.</li>
        <li>Before measuring the measurement, let your breath out freely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Waist circumference</h3>
    <p>With the measuring instrument parallel to the floor, you should measure the circumference of your waist halfway between the top of your hipbones and the bottom of the rib cage. When you take the measurement, you must be exhaling. </p>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi weight ranges waist circumference.jpg" alt="waist circumference" class="medium-img">
    <p><b>Male</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased health risk: Having greater than or equal to <b>94cm</b></li>
        <li>High health risk: Having greater than or equal to <b>102cm</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Female</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased health risk: Having greater than or equal to <b>80cm</b></li>
        <li>High health risk: Having greater than or equal to <b>88cm</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Waist to hip ratio</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi weight ranges waist to hip ratio.jpeg" alt="waist to hip ratio" class="medium-img">
    <p>Calculate the circumference of your waist (as described above) and hip length at the broadest portion of your hips to get your waistline to hip ratio. To calculate the ratio, divide your hip measurement by your belly circumference.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A waistline to hip ratio of more than 0.85 in females is linked to a higher-than-average risk.</li>
        <li>A waistline to hip ratio of more than 1.00 in men is linked to higher-than-average risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosing Weight Type with BMI</h3>
    <h4>BMI table for adults</h4>
    <p>Based on BMI readings, this is the recommended body weight for adults by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Both of men and women who are at least 20 years old can utilise it.</p>
