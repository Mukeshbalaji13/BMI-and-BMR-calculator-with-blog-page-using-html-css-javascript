    <h1>BMI AND PHYSIOTHERAPY</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The increasing epidemic of obesity and the rise in people with high BMIs are the main causes for concern when it comes to BMI. BMI is used in eating disorders to determine the proper exercise prescriptions; see Anorexia Nervosa. A medical condition known as obesity occurs when excess body fat builds up to the level which could be dangerous to an individual’s health. Body mass index (BMI) is used to define it, and the waist-hip ratio and overall cardiovascular risk factors are used to further assess how fat is distributed.</p>
    <P>In the US, it is the most prevalent nutritional disorder. A person's standard of life as well as life expectancy may suffer significantly as a result of obesity. Lower values are used in some East Asian nations. Obesity raises the risk of a number of illnesses and conditions, especially cardiovascular conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea that is obstructive, stroke, coronary artery disease, gallbladder disease, particular kinds of cancer, arthritis, and depression.Due to their slowed metabolism, older adults are more likely to be obese because they eat more and physical activity less than younger adults.</P>
    <p>The most frequent causes of obesity are an excessive food intake, a lack of exercise, and a genetic predisposition. Some cases are primarily brought on by genes, endocrine issues, medications, or mental health issues. Medical research does not support the idea which obese people eat less but still put on weight as a result of a slow metabolism. Due to the extra energy needed for maintaining an increased body mass, obese people generally expend more energy than their normal counterparts.</p>


    <h3>Obesity BMI</h3>
    <p>Obesity is frequently identified using the BMI (body mass index). For the BMI formula, multiply the weight of the person with pounds by 703, and then divide the result by the height in inches. Alternately, you could divide the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters.</p>
    <p>BMI typically gives a standard estimation of body fat. BMI cannot evaluate body mass index, so some people, like muscular athletes, may fall into a higher BMI category despite having normal levels of body fat.</p>
    <p>In order to inform treatment choices, numerous physicians also measure a patient's waist, thigh, chest, arm, and leg circumferences. Men with a waist size over 40 inches (102 centimeters) and women with a waistline evaluation over 35 inches (89 centimeters) are more likely to have obesity-related health conditions.</p>


    <h3>Management of obesity</h3>
    <h4>Dieting</h4>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy diet.jpg" alt="diet">
    <p>Dieting is the practice of eating in a controlled and supervised way in order to reduce, keep up, or improve body weight, as well as to avoid and manage diseases like diabetes. Overweight or obese people frequently use a restricted diet to lose weight, sometimes in conjunction with exercise. Some people stick to a diet to put on weight (usually muscle). Additionally, diets can be implemented to keep a healthy weight and enhance wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Low-fat, low-carb, low-calorie, very low-calorie, and most recently flexible dieting are different types of weight loss diets. With a weight loss of 2-4 kilograms over 12–18 months in each study, a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled experiments found there was no distinction among low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, as well as low-fat diets. Regardless of the macronutrients prioritized, every calorie-reduced diet types result in equal weight loss at two years. Any diet that lowers calorie intake is typically the most effective.</p>
    
    <h4>Physiotherapy-Exercise</h4>
    <p>Any physical activity that improves or maintains physical fitness, overall health, and wellness is considered exercise. It is done for a variety of reasons, including to promote strength and growth, slow down the ageing process, strengthen the heart and muscles, hone athletic abilities, lose or maintain weight, improve health, and just for fun. Many people opt to work out outside where they can socialize, gather in groups, and improve their wellbeing.</p>
    <h5>Depending on their overall impact on the body, physical exercises are typically divided into three categories:</h5>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy exercise image.avif" alt="exercise">
    <p>Any kind of workout that uses a lot of muscles and makes the body use a greater amount of oxygen compared to it would at rest is considered an aerobic exercise. Cardiovascular endurance is improved through aerobic exercise. jogging, cycling, swimming, walking quickly, skipping a rope, rowing, hiking, the act of dancing, playing tennis, regular workouts, and long distance running are all examples of aerobic exercise.</p>
    <p>Strength as well as resistance training fall under the category of anaerobic exercise, which can strong, strengthen, and improve muscle mass as well as enhance the density of bones, balance, and coordination. Bench press, lunges, squats, pull-ups, and push-ups are a few examples of strength exercises. In addition to sprinting and high-intensity interval training, anaerobic exercise also includes strength training, resistance training, eccentric training, and interval training. Lifting weights with dumbbells or weight machines is referred to as resistance training. Stretching exercises like flexibility drills help ensure that your muscles, connections, and the ligaments move more freely.</p>
    <p>Exercises that increase your stability also lower your risk of falling or suffering other injuries. There is no need for equipment to perform these exercises. For instance, when practicing single-leg balance, you must maintain your balance for 15 seconds. positioned up and settling down not using your hands is known as a stand-sit.</p>
    <p>Your healthcare professional will create a personalized exercise plan for you that outlines the frequency, duration, intensity, and different kinds of exercise. Normally, you'll aim to lose 10% of your body weight in a period of six months. To maintain the self-discipline necessary for long-term success, ensure that to set goals that are SMART. Consider using a smartphone app or a wearable device (like a Fitbit) to monitor your physical activity as well. It enables you to track your development over time, assists in goal-setting, and maintains your motivation.</p>
    <p>Exercising flexibility stretches and lengthens muscles. Stretching exercises, for example, help to maintain limber muscles and increase joint flexibility. The objective is to increase range of motion because doing so can lower the risk of injury.Training that emphasizes precision, flexibility, strength, and speed can also be considered a form of physical activity.</p>
    <p>'Dynamic' and'static' are terms that are occasionally used. Due to improved blood flow, "dynamic" exercises like steady running often result in a lowering of diastole blood pressure during exercise. On the other hand, static exercise (like lifting weights) can cause a significant, albeit brief, increase in systolic pressure while the exercise is being performed.</p>
    
    <h4>Cardiovascular system</h4>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy cardiovascular system.jpg" alt="Cardiovascular system">
    <p>Exercise has been shown to have positive effects on the cardiovascular system. Lack of exercise is a distinct risk indicator for the occurrence of coronary heart disease and is directly correlated with cardiovascular mortality. Low levels of physical activity raise the mortality risk from cardiovascular diseases.</p>
    <p>Children who engage in physical activity lose more body fat and have better cardiovascular health.</p>
    <h5>Tests will be administered by your physical therapist to determine your level of fitness. These examinations will evaluate your:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Movement</li>
      <li>Strength</li>
      <li>Coordination</li>
      <li>Balance</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The following specific obesity tests may also be carried out by your physical therapist:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>To determine your body mass index (BMI) (based on the height and mass).</li>
      <li>Check the size of your skinfolds and waist.</li>
      <li>How much body fat do you have?</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Your physical therapist will collaborate with you as part of your treatment plan to:</h5>
    <p><b>Decrease pain:</b> <img class="small-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy decrease pain.jpg" alt="pain reduction">A physical therapist can show you how to perform tasks safely and with the lowest possible level of discomfort. Increased movement can aid in pain relief. A plan will be created by your physical therapist to encourage you to move more.</p>
    <p><b>enhance your cardiovascular fitness:</b> <img class="small-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy enhancing cardio vascular.jpg" alt="cardio ftness">The physical therapist who treats you will create an aerobic exercise regimen for you that is heart-healthy. Your metabolic rate (the process of obtaining energy from food) will improve as a result of this programme. You will also burn more calories as a result. Physical therapists assist adults, kids, and individuals with disabilities in engaging in aerobic exercise to their comfort level.</p>
    <p><b>Strengthen up:</b> <img class="small-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy strengthening up.jpg" alt="strengthening"> You will learn exercises from your physical therapist to treat muscle weakness or increase your strength. Increasing muscle mass and strength can, </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Burn calories</li>
      <li>Simplify daily tasks</li>
      <li>Reduce joint discomfort</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can avoid putting stress on your joints by engaging in gentle, low-impact resistance training with elastic bands.</p>
    <p><b>Boost your movement:</b> <img class="small-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy boosting movement.png" alt="movement"> The physical therapist who treats you will select a specific set of exercises and therapies to aid in regaining stiff joints' normal range of motion. Your physical therapist may start by performing passive motions for you. You will then advance to independent, active exercises.</p>
    <p><b>Improve posture and flexibility:</b> <img src="bmi and physiotherapy posture and flexibility.webp" alt="posture and flexibility" class="small-img"> Any tight muscles you have will be found out by your physical therapist. Any tight muscles can be gently stretched thanks to their instruction. Your posture will also be evaluated by your physical therapist. They will give you exercises to help you become more adept at maintaining good posture. Maintaining correct posture can make difficult tasks less difficult and more painful. Additionally, it can help with breathing.</p>
    <p><b>intensify the pace of activity: </b> <img src="bmi and physiotherapy pace of activity.jpg" alt="pace of activity" class="small-img"> The physical therapist who treats you will talk with you about your activity objectives. To assist you in achieving your objectives as soon as possible and in the safest manner possible, they will create a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs.</p>


    <h3>How can exercise aid in the fight against obesity?</h3>
    <p>Weight loss is the aim of obesity treatment. Any weight-loss program must include exercise, which ought to grow into an irreversible component of your way of life. The advantages of exercise can include: </p>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy exercise aid against obesity.webp" alt="bmi and physiotherapy exercise aid against obesity" style="height: 320px">
    <ul>
      <li>burning calories and losing weight</li>
      <li>maintaining muscle tone</li>
      <li>increasing metabolic rate </li>
      <li>improving circulation</li>
      <li>enhancing heart and lung function </li>
      <li>enhancing self-control</li>
      <li>lowering stress levels</li>
      <li>enhancing concentration </li>
      <li>enhancing appearance </li>
      <li>lessening depression </li>
      <li>suppressing appetite</li>
      <li>aiding in sleep</li>
      <li>reducing your risk of developing certain cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colon cancer</li>
      <li>avoiding insulin resistance, hypertension, and high cholesterol</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Osteoarthritis and obesity</h3>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy Osteoarthritis and obesity.jpg" alt="Osteoarthritis and obesity">
    <p>Physical activity is one of the best ways to manage the condition. Moving is regarded as a crucial component of the treatment plan, despite the fact that it may be difficult to consider physical activity when the joints hurt. According to studies, doing easy exercises such as walking around the neighbourhood or joining a fun class can help you lose weight and manage your pain.</p>
    <p>Strengthening exercises help strengthen the muscles that are around OA-affected joints, which reduces pain and lessens the strain on the affected joints. Exercises that involve range of motion help maintain and enhance joint flexibility and lessen stiffness.</p>
    <p>Exercise that is aerobic can help you lose weight and increase energy and stamina. Before beginning an exercise programme, consult a doctor.</p>
    <h4>Weight management</h4>
    <p>Being overweight puts additional strain on the joints that support your body weight, including your hips, knees, feet, and back. People with OA may experience less pain and less further joint damage after losing weight. The fundamental guideline for weight loss is to consume fewer calories while increasing physical activity.</p>
    <h4>Stretching</h4>
    <p>Joints can be stretched slowly and gently to increase flexibility, decrease stiffness, and ease pain. Yoga and meditation are excellent forms of exercise for managing stiffness.</p>


    <h3>Stroke and coronary artery disease</h3>
    <img class="medium-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy stroke and heart disease.png" alt="stroke and heart disease">
    <p>Stroke and coronary artery disease are more likely in people who are overweight because they have elevated blood pressure and cholesterol. Cardiovascular disease or stroke risk is increased by either of those conditions.</p>
    <p>The good thing is that even a small weight loss can lower your risk of cardiovascular disease or having a stroke. It has been demonstrated that losing more weight can further reduce the risk.</p>

    
    <h3>Obesity and cancer</h3>
    <img class="medium-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy obesity and cancer.jpg" alt="obesity and cancer">
    <p>Obesity has been linked to tumours of the  intestines ,breast cancer(once they've menopause), the endometrial (the covering of the female reproductive organ), kidney, and Oesophagus. Additionally, some studies have found connections between obesity and pancreatic, ovarian, and gallbladder cancers.</p>

    
    <h3>Gallbladder Illness</h3>
    <img class="medium-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy gallblader illness.jpg" alt="gallblader illness">
    <p>If you are overweight, gallstones and gallbladder disease are more prevalent.</p>
    <p>Ironically, losing weight can increase your risk of developing gallstones, especially if the weight loss is rapid or substantial. Gallstones are less likely to develop in people who lose the weight at an average of approximately one pound per week.</p>

    
    <h3>Gout</h3>
    <img class="medium-img" src="bmi and physiotherapy gout.webp" alt="gout">
    <p>A medical condition which impacts the joints is gout. When your blood contains an excessive amount of uric acid, it occurs. The additional uric acid may crystallise and accumulate in the joints as crystals.</p>
    <p>Overweight people are more likely to develop gout. Gout is more likely to develop if you weigh more.</p>

    
    <h3>Obesity and Sleep Apnea</h3>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy obesity and sleep apnea.webp" alt="obesity and sleep apnea" class="medium-img">
    <p>Obesity and Sleep Apnea are related breathing disorders. A person with sleep apnea may snore loudly and experience brief episodes of not breathing while asleep. Sleep apnea may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke and contribute to daytime sleepiness. Obesity frequently makes sleep apnea worse.</p><br/>

    
    <h3>Treatment for Obesity within Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy type 1 diabetes.jpg" alt="type 1 diabetes" style="width: 60%;">
    <p>Obesity is more prevalent in people with a type 1 diabetes than it was in 1988 25% of people aged 40 to 49 with a type 1 diabetes were overweight or obese versus 68% in 2007. In order to lose weight, people who have type 1 diabetes must continue taking their insulin and aim for a caloric deficit of 500–700 kcal per day. The ADA advises youngsters with type 1 diabetes to engage in 150 minutes every week of moderate physical activity as well as a couple of hours of resistance training, which are the CDC's recommendations for all adults. Individuals along with diabetes who have type 1 should be closely watched for hypoglycemia when beginning a new exercise program or calorie reduction.</p>
    <p>Pramlintide might be regarded for individuals with diabetes who have type 1 with the goal for decreasing their blood sugar level requirements and encouraging weight loss. Additionally, the weight loss treatments mentioned higher than can also be taken into consideration by individuals with diabetes who have type 1 diabetes.</p>

    
    <h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
    <p>Obese or overweight individuals are more likely to have type 2 diabetes. By reducing your weight, adopting a balanced diet, obtaining enough sleep, and increasing your physical activity, you can lower your risk for developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <p>Losing weight and increasing your physical activity can help you manage the levels of sugar in your blood if you're suffering from type 2 diabetes. You might need less diabetes medication if you become more active.</p>
    <h4>Diet and physical therapy for type 2 diabetics who are obese</h4>
    <img src="bmi and physiotherapy type 2 diabetes.jpg" alt="type 2 diabetes" style="width: 60%;">
    <p>Patients with diabetes who have type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese and ready to lose weight should be prescribed a diet, exercise program, and behavioral therapy that aims for a 5% weight loss.</p>
    <p>Weight loss results from diets with the same calorie limit but different carbohydrate, fat, and protein contents.</p>
    <p>Patients who meet their short-term weight loss objectives should be prescribed long-term (nearly one year) thorough weight maintenance programs. Such programs should encourage regular contact (at least once a month), ongoing body weight monitoring (on a weekly or even more regularly), continued eating of a low-calorie diet, and high levels of exercise (200-300 minutes per week).</p>
    <p>Short-term exposure (3-month) intense behavioral changes that use extremely low-calorie diets (800 kcal/day) and overall meal replacements for carefully chosen patients in healthcare environments with close medical surveillance may be recommended in order to accomplish a weight loss of >5%. Such programs must include long-term complete weight maintenance counselling if they are to maintain weight loss.</p>
    <p>Lifestyle modifications that lead to modest and sustained weight loss have even greater benefits for overweight or obese individuals with diabetes who have type 2 diabetes, insufficient glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control, as well as other obesity-related medical conditions. These benefits include lower blood pressure, improved LDL and HDL cholesterol, and a decrease in the need for medication to control blood sugar, blood pressure, and lipids.</p>

    
    <h3>Lifestyle interventions</h3>
    <img src="bmi blog bmi and physiotherapy lifestyle interventions.jpg" alt="lifestyle interventions">
    <p>Weight loss can be achieved with lifestyle programmes that produce an energy deficit of 500–750 kcal per day or offer 1,200–1,500 kcal per day for women as well as 1,500–1,800 kcal per day for men, depending on the person's starting body weight. While benefits may be noticed with a weight loss of as little as 5%, an ongoing weight loss of around 7% is preferred.</p>
    <p>These diets might differ in the foods they forbid (like foods high in fat or carbohydrates), but they work if they produce the required energy deficit (13–16). The patient's preferences should guide the diet selection. In order to achieve an energy deficit of 500–750 kcal per day, intensive behavioural lifestyle interventions should span 16 sessions over the course of six months. These sessions should centre on diet, exercise, and behavioural strategies. In either group or individual sessions, interventions should be delivered by trained interventionists.</p>
    <p>Individuals with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese and who lost weight during a 6-month intensive behavioural lifestyle intervention should enrol in long-term (1-year) thorough weight loss maintenance programmes that include ongoing body weight monitoring (weekly or more often), continued consumption of a low-calorie diet, and high levels of exercise (20). Some proprietary and commercial weight-loss programmes have produced encouraging results.</p>
    <p>Short-term (3 months) high-intensity lifestyle interventions using very low-calorie diets (defined as 800 kcal/day) and overall meal replacements may result in greater short-term loss of weight (10–15%) than intensive behavioural lifestyle interventions, which typically result in 5% weight loss. These interventions must be administered by trained professionals in medical care environments with close medical monitoring.</p>
