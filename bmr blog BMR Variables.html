    <h1>BMR VARIABLES</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h4>Muscle Mass</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-bmr variables-muscle mass.webp" alt="muscle mass" class="small-img">
    <p>Aerobic exercise, including running or cycling, has little effect on BMR. unfortunately heavy workouts, including weights lifting, might indirectly develop BMR by peaking the muscle weight, that could develop the resting energy consumption. The more muscular mass an individual has in their physical composition, the greater the BMR necessary to keep their body at a specific level.</p>
    <h4>Age</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-bmr variables-age.png" alt="age" class="small-img">
    <p>The more senior and limber a person is, the lesser their the body's metabolic or the minimum calorie intake required to keep their organs operating at a given level.</p>
    <h4>Genetics</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog-bmr variables-genetics.webp" alt="genetics" class="small-img">
    <p>BMR is influenced by hereditary features passed down from ancestors.</p>
    <h4>Weather</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog- bmr variables- waether.avif" alt="waerther" class="small-img">
    <p>The energy requirement to maintain a homeostatic temperature of the body raises BMR in cold conditions. Similarly, excessive external heat can elevate BMR when the body releases energy to cool internal organs. Every 1.36 degree Fahrenheit increase in a person's internal temperature causes a 7% increase in BMR.</p>
    <h4>Diet</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog- bmr variables- diet.jpg" alt="diet" class="small-img">
    <p>Small, regularly spaced meals raise BMR. Starvation, on the contrary hand, may decrease BMR by up to 30%. A human body, like a phone, will engage in sacrifices regarding energy levels, moods, bodily physique maintenance, and mental processes so as to more effectively utilize what amount of caloric energy is used to support it, similar to how a phone goes onto power-saving mode within the last five percent of its battery.</p>
    <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog- bmr variables- pregnancy.jpeg" alt="pregnancy" class="small-img">
    <p>Internally increasing BMR by ensuring the survival of a distinct fetus. This is because pregnant women prefer to consume more calories than usual. Furthermore, depending on hormonal changes, menopause can raise or decrease BMR.</p>
    <h4>Supplements</h4>
    <img src="./bmi and bmr assets/bmi and bmr blog- bmr variables- supplements.jpg" alt="supplements" class="small-img">
    <p>Some supplements or medications increase BMR, mostly to aid in weight loss. Caffeine is a popular one.</p>


    <h3>BMR Tests</h3>
    <p>Online BMR testing based on strict formulae aren't the most accurate way to determine an individual's BMR. It is preferable to visit a professional specialist or use a calorimetry instrument to determine BMR. These portable devices can be found in a variety of fitness and health centers, medical offices, including weight-loss clinics.</p>


    <h3>How do We Need to Use BMR for Loosing Fat or Gain Muscle Weight?</h3>
    <p>Once you've calculated your TDEE using your BMR, you can ensure that the dietary regimen you're following corresponds for your rate of energy use and does not provide you excessive or insufficient calories. Empowered with this understanding, rather than guessing or simply adhering to a plan without tailoring it to your own needs, can mean the difference between muscle gains and fat loss.</p>


    <h3>How can you change your BMR</h3>
    <p>The body's metabolic rate (BMR) is determined by several factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sex</li>
        <li>weight</li>
        <li>height</li>
        <li>age</li>
        <li>ethnicity</li>
        <li>weight history</li>
        <li>body composition</li>
        <li>genetic factors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may alter your body measurement and composition by addressing these issues. So, if you'd like to alter your BMR, you should start by building muscle.</p>
    <p>A person's BMR and RMR are calculated using numerous factors. Only two of these parameters are possibly changeable by a person which is, body composition and weight.</p>
    <p>A person's BMR and RMR can thus be altered by losing fat & boosting lean muscle mass. To accomplish this, one may attempt the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>consuming a well-balanced diet</li>
        <li>engaging in weight training</li>
        <li>engaging in frequent cardiovascular activity</li>
    </ul>
